Hey everyone! I struggled with insomnia and decided to build something to help.

sheepcount.rest is a simple, beautiful website where you watch sheep jump over a fence. No ads, no signup, completely free.

Features:
- Peaceful animated sheep
- Starry night sky
- Sleep counter
- Works on mobile

I'd love to hear if this helps anyone! The domain name itself is a reminder to rest 😊
